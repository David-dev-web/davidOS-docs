## ðŸš€ DavidOS Roadmap

This is a living document that outlines the future plans for DavidOS. Ideas and contributions are always welcome!

### Version 1.1 (Short-Term)
* [ ] **Bug Fixes:** Address any reported issues from the initial release.
* [ ] **Pre-installed Applications:** Add a curated selection of useful, lightweight applications (e.g., a modern web browser, a simple text editor).
* [ ] **Theme Enhancements:** Integrate more icons and improve theme consistency across all applications.
* [ ] **Performance Tweaks:** Optimize startup times and reduce memory usage.

### Version 2.0 (Mid-Term)
* [ ] **Custom Welcome Screen:** Develop a unique welcome application that guides new users through the system.
* [ ] **System Update-Tool:** Create a simple script or tool to allow users to easily update to new versions of DavidOS.
* [ ] **Expanded Hardware Support:** Improve compatibility with a wider range of Wi-Fi cards and graphics drivers.
* [ ] **Power-User Tools:** Integrate optional tools for developers and power-users (e.g., Docker, a pre-configured terminal).

### The Dream (Long-Term)
* [ ] **Unique Desktop Environment:** Explore the possibility of moving beyond a theme to a custom, lightweight desktop environment based on XFCE or LXDE.
* [ ] **DavidOS App Store:** A simple software center to easily install and remove curated, retro-style applications.
* [ ] **Community-driven Features:** Build a system for the community to vote on and contribute new features.
